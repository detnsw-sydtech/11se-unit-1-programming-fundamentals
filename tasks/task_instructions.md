# Task — Interactive Calculator

## Overview
In this task, you will design and implement a simple interactive calculator program. This activity introduces the core programming concepts of variables, data types, input/output, selection, iteration, and functions.

Your goal is to build a program that:
1. Asks the user for two numbers  
2. Asks the user to choose an operation  
3. Performs the calculation  
4. Displays the result  
5. Handles invalid input safely

## Learning Outcomes
This task helps you develop skills in:
- Designing algorithms using structured steps  
- Using variables and data types  
- Applying sequence, selection, and iteration  
- Writing and calling functions  
- Testing and debugging programs

## Requirements

### 1. Input
- Prompt the user for two numbers  
- Convert input to the correct data type  
- Validate that the input is numeric  

### 2. Control Structures
Use `if/elif/else` to choose the operation.

### 3. Functions
Write at least two functions, for example:
- `calculate(a, b, operation)`
- `display_result(value)`

### 4. Error Handling
Your program must:
- Handle division by zero  
- Handle invalid menu choices  
- Handle non‑numeric input  

### 5. Output
Display the result clearly and professionally.

## Example Interaction

Welcome to the Interactive Calculator!
Enter first number: 12
Enter second number: 5
Choose operation (+, -, *, /): *
Result: 12 * 5 = 60
